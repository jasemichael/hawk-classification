I noted no obvious red/pink color to tail which could be more suggestive of a dark morph Calurus subspecies.  I also considered dark morph Rough-legged Hawk.  However this bird was soaring with 2 other eastern Red-tailed Hawks all 3 appearing to have similar body shape/size. I also noticed no obvious darker/larger terminal band to suggest dark morph Rough-legged Hawk. Observed this bird in flight well with 10x binoculars. I noted no warm brown coloration to the head that is suggested in some photos. This appears to be attributed to the lighting of sun exposure to the head but not the underparts and poor quality photos. Continued in flight to the NW and out of sight with the other 2 Red-tailed Hawks. Did not appear to be staying around the airport.,Buteo jamaicensis,hrthaw1,Group,8101,,2.00,2,,1097,1934

(Info. rec'd. from an Oregon Aviation Wildlife Technician.)","As I was walking back along the levee, two buteos came flying in from the east. At the time I thought both were RSH’s, but now I think the first one was a RSH and the second one a RTH. The RTH perched in a eucalyptus tree on the far side of the north ditch. It had conspicuous orange wing-tags on both wings. The left tag read D2 or DZ. I did a Google search and found a website to report wing-tagged raptors.  I submitted a report.  On November 23, I received an e-mail reply from Erick Shore, Aviation Wildlife Technician for the Port of Portland in Oregon: “The code you saw was most likely D2, which is a red-tailed hawk that was first captured at Portland International Airport earlier this year in July.  It was released in Halfway, OR and your sighting is the first we’ve received since then.  It’s good to hear that it is still alive and well. “Once again, thank you for taking the time to send us a report. We truly appreciate your participation and with the help of individuals such as you, we are able to determine the most successful release sites. This in turn helps to reduce the number of birds returning to PDX and contributes to a safer airfield for both people and birds.”   On November 24, I received this additional information From Carole Hallett, the Wildlife Biologist who did the banding: “This bird was one of two fledglings from a nest very close to the airport (PDX). D2's dad (8J) has been with this nesting territory since 2011 and his mom (unbanded) for only about 3 years. We caught D2 and his brother (D1) on the airfield when they were young fledglings. Because they were still dependent on their parents at this age rather than take them for release right away they were held  for a time in a huge flight cage under the care of our local Audubon Wildlife Care Center. Once they were ready to go  they were banded and tagged and released out near Halfway. You spotted him 85 days later ~560 miles SSE from the release site. That's a long way! He is one of fewer than maybe a dozen or so PDX red-tails that have re-sighted down in CA in over twenty years of banding. Good spotting.”",Buteo jamaicensis,rethaw,Species,8094,,5.00,1,,863,1306

A couple of nice kettles too. Birds started coming from directly north before quickly shifting eastwards. It stayed east for about 40 minutes before switching west and then north again. The RTHA would kettle over Bernal and then explode into individual birds... and then float down towards me. Additionally, the raven's were fairly aggressive today so I got a good 20 birds from just raven mobs. Two of the kettles had a sharpie, one had a merlin, one had a shouldy, and one had a roughie. I tried to pick out other buteos and Harlan's to no avail. I managed to confirm around 90% of the birds as the calurus ssp. There was a very rusty colored dark morph and a buffy intermediate morph, but every single other bird was a light morph. Additionally, one juvenile RTHA had extensive banding on the primaries sort of like a Harlan's but the overall appearance is diagnostic for calurus, see the photo below.

Lots of birds coming in from the NW today, and in particularly large kettles. Our tally was: 3, 4, 2, 15, 5, 23, 3, 8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 2, 1. Seven were dark morphs (5 adults and 2 juveniles); 3 were intermediate (all adults); and the rest were light morphs. One of the dark morphs is a strong candidate for Harlan's but I will have to review the photos. The larger concentrations were typically all juveniles, and the singles and pairs were typically adults. About 1/5 of the raptors also working ""the gap"" which is the flyway directly east of my location. The winds started out in the N/NW but moved more and more west as the day went on. Also completely sunny, not a cloud in the sky.

Lots of birds coming in from the NW today, and in particularly large kettles. Our tally was: 3, 4, 2, 15, 5, 23, 3, 8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 2, 1. Seven were dark morphs (5 adults and 2 juveniles); 3 were intermediate (all adults); and the rest were light morphs. One of the dark morphs is a strong candidate for Harlan's but I will have to review the photos. The larger concentrations were typically all juveniles, and the singles and pairs were typically adults. About 1/5 of the raptors also working ""the gap"" which is the flyway directly east of my location. The winds started out in the N/NW but moved more and more west as the day went on. Also completely sunny, not a cloud in the sky. Overall great movement and this is probably the last weekend of good hawk numbers before they rapidly decline for winter.",Buteo jamaicensis,rethaw,Species,8094,,.00,0,,1536,2048

It was released out in Tillamook County. Yours is the first reported resighting since release. The bird is likely a female based on measurements.
